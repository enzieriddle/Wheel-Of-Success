# Wheel-of-Success
In this project I created a browser version of “Wheel of Success”, a word guessing game where players will click letters 
from an onscreen keyboard to try to guess a random phrase.  Using Javascript, I created an array of phrases, wrote functions 
to choose a random phrase from that array, split the phrase into letters, and put those letters onto the game board. 
A player can keep choosing letters until they make five incorrect guesses. If the letter the plalyer chose isn’t in the phrase, one of the player’s 5 guesses is removed.  
If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen will display. If the player guesses incorrectly 5 times, a losing screen will display.
